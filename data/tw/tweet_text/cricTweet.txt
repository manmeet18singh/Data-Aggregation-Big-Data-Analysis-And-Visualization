On 5 April 1930, in England's 1st innings of the 4th Test v WI at Kingston, Andy Sandham made 325, which made him Test cricket's 1st triple centurion beating Foster's 287 made in 1903. The Don then went on to take the Test record in July 1930 with his 334 v England at Headingley. https://t.co/hcLd9qZXCH

@Sai_Tweets_ @tyagi007amit @cricketaakash Russel Warner baistow are not Indian first of all.

On 5 April 1930, in England's 1st innings of the 4th Test v WI at Kingston, Andy Sandham made 325, which made him Test cricket's 1st triple centurion beating Foster's 287 made in 1903. The Don then went on to take the Test record in July 1930 with his 334 v England at Headingley. https://t.co/hcLd9qZXCH

This season @SunRisers overseas players have an average match impact of +12.0 runs per match - comfortably the most of all teams.

@TheSaintKopite Actually not crazy (although I disagree with the reasoning since the ball doesn't move even at the top). But a left hander in the middle order would be invaluable against the wrist spin and Warner has done well there in the IPL. But I don't think its realistic.

@theanalyst @AnnieChave @aidybidd @ToppersSnr @tomjohnson5788 @telecricket @gurneyhf So yes, I've been saying the same thing. However the 100 is not the answer, neither is the ipl. If cricket on fta is actually going to draw in new viewers rather than simply entertaining existing enthusiasts, it needs to be international cricket. Format is less important.
Why are you not giving chances To himmat singh and milind kumar. They would be solid in the middle and open with shivam dube. If shivam can play first 6 overs with his potential i would be nice plateform for Kohli, abd n rest of all. @RCBTweets @IPL #IPL2019 #RCBvKKR #RCB

@AnnieChave @aidybidd @theanalyst @ToppersSnr @tomjohnson5788 @telecricket @gurneyhf It is, but being inspired by what you see on the TV is a big part of getting into the game. I played cricket at school for two years without really getting it or enjoying it, it was only when I watched warne in the 93 ashes that I suddenly felt inspired to want to play.

These are keen cricketers who love T20 cricket, but they were bored out of their minds. They simply didn't care about two teams from places they'd never been.

@hrithik_singh03 @cricketaakash You want to stick to players who are out of form... haven't played mainstream cricket for so long - just because they were heroes once? Or would you prefer going with players who are in form, better today and are possible long term investments?

On 5 April 1930, in England's 1st innings of the 4th Test v WI at Kingston, Andy Sandham made 325, which made him Test cricket's 1st triple centurion beating Foster's 287 made in 1903.

This season @SunRisers overseas players have an average match impact of +12.0 runs per match - comfortably the most of all teams.

If cricket on fta is actually going to draw in new viewers rather than simply entertaining existing enthusiasts, it needs to be international cricket. Format is less important.
Why are you not giving chances To himmat singh and milind kumar. They would be solid in the middle and open with shivam dube. If shivam can play first 6 overs with his potential i would be nice plateform for Kohli, abd n rest of all. @RCBTweets @IPL #IPL2019 #RCBvKKR #RCB

Is there any need for people to watch videos on full sound unless they‚Äôre sharing with others? It‚Äôs just not cricket, if you ask me. Especially when one is trying to digest an article on historic France and De Gaulle? Courtesy: a thing of the past; much like reading.
@MHafeez22 Have a safe journey sir really missing u in our pak cricket team
- the Afghanistan Cricket authorities believe Gulbadin has ample experience to lead their side into WC! However, to me, not good timing to dismiss experienced Asghar Afghan as skipper.

@GabbbarSingh @vikrantarora24 I beg to disagree. A person may be interested in cricket but not way too interested. For eg,I generally use their pop up swiggy to book more often these days.Yes the percentage of people alike me would be very less though. In fact we like to know how many actually buy like that.

@AnnieChave @aidybidd @theanalyst @ToppersSnr @tomjohnson5788 @telecricket @gurneyhf It is, but being inspired by what you see on the TV is a big part of getting into the game. I played cricket at school for two years without really getting it or enjoying it, it was only when I watched warne in the 93 ashes that I suddenly felt inspired to want to play.

@Changing366 @ChiranjitOjha @IndSuperLeague @Changing366 you are not getting my point. Cricket is obviously boring in a 20-team league. With football, the more teams in a league, the more exciting and competitive it gets. Thats why people watch the premier league or laliga or serie a or bundesliga

@sanjaymanjrekar It's important to keep Kohli calm and fresh. Now e is immense pressure in his batting and captaincy. So I think e need some rest before WC to come good. IPL is just entertainment for us and money for them.

Loving seeing so many football/ cricket pitches with running tracks around them with little clubhouses, some with floodlights too here in Barbados. Saw a local men's cup match last night them kids training after school. 74 football clubs in a popn of 275k
Love this from #Budget2019 as indicative of #ScoMo priorities. T20 cricket gets &gt;$7m. Then $9.5m over 4 yrs to train 5000 GPs to identify ppl experiencing #domesticviolence. So 1 in 6 GPs to spot the abused. Guess so. @JulieCollinsMP @LaTrioli @vanOnselenP @PatsKarvelas

@ovshake42 @senantix @Cricket_Books Of course they did. Your just circular. You just quoted respectable historians who spread the word and still admired him.
@Bluetrainz1974 @senantix @Cricket_Books If you agree that Cardus need not be taken seriously for facts, should not be considered a journalist, and should be hailed only for his prose, I think we are on the same page.
@Bluetrainz1974 @ovshake42 @Cricket_Books Yes we care about the truth. Cardus misled generations by painting wrong pictures of facts and personalities, camouflaging them as match reports. He did this in his capacity as a journalist for Manchester Guardian.But it is pointless to discuss any further

@ovshake42 @senantix @Cricket_Books So according to you journalism standards never change and in 100 years your view should and must be the only view of journalism. You will be sadly disappointed. Everyone knew cardus was a poet of cricket. To call him a fraud or a liar says more about your quest than him.

@cricBC T-20, in fact ODI too is a cruel game for bowlers. Too much loaded in favour of batsmen. Not a healthy cricket. Apart from free hits to batsmen and other bowling restrictions,the boundaries are made 15-20 yards shorter. It is a cruel joke to play with 60-65 yards boundaries.

@anubhav_roda @akshar2026 @IPL @StarSportsIndia @DelhiCapitals I have no clue why would any team go for a player whose T20 SR is terrible. Plus, even if you take that sort of a batsman you need to put him at no. 3 as an innings stabilizer. Asking him to finish games or give the late flourish is asking too much from him.

Royal Challengers Bangalore trying to get their first win of IPL 2019 face a  mighty challenger in the form of Kolkata Knight Riders, who are in red hot form in IPL 2019. Andre Russell will be a great threat, keeping in perspective, the way he has been smashing it all around.
-another problem there is with the double headers and all that is tv time, the Feb to march period is perfect for the womans game cos there is no other sport dominating the scene then. cricket is over and the mens hasn't quiet started. so there is a slot in Sevens sport coverage-

"Test batting average of 49.08, something only 47 men have bettered in the 135 yrs Test Cricket has been played, &amp; which places him above such luminaries as Peter May, Neil Harvey, Ted Dexter &amp; Rohan Kanhai ‚Äì yet people remember him just for his fielding."https://t.co/pRQpuRWU5o https://t.co/25W4lO8qsr
@Tim32_cricket @investor_bod @WorcsCCC Signed Rutherford today for the first month before Ferguson arrives.  Plus Wessels, so think batting will be ok.  Big question is who to open with Mitch.  Probably Fell?

I feel like artists and athletes can both go through slumps, but yoh, when you're finally due and everything clicks, it's fucking magic. Tonight felt like coming out of a slump for me. To put in cricket terms, I just scored a century after 5 ducks in a row. Feels good man.

Okay so @DelhiCapitals go down once again and this time comprehensively to the impressive @SunRisers. Their batting is an issue. Unless they start putting up good totals with the bat their bowling attack cannot win them games. #DCvSRH #IPL2019 #Cricket

On 5 April 1930, in England's 1st innings of the 4th Test v WI at Kingston, Andy Sandham made 325, which made him Test cricket's 1st triple centurion beating Foster's 287 made in 1903.

This season @SunRisers overseas players have an average match impact of +12.0 runs per match - comfortably the most of all teams.

If cricket on fta is actually going to draw in new viewers rather than simply entertaining existing enthusiasts, it needs to be international cricket. Format is less important.
Why are you not giving chances To himmat singh and milind kumar. They would be solid in the middle and open with shivam dube. If shivam can play first 6 overs with his potential i would be nice plateform for Kohli, abd n rest of all. @RCBTweets @IPL #IPL2019 #RCBvKKR #RCB

Is there any need for people to watch videos on full sound unless they‚Äôre sharing with others? It‚Äôs just not cricket, if you ask me. Especially when one is trying to digest an article on historic France and De Gaulle? Courtesy: a thing of the past; much like reading.
@MHafeez22 Have a safe journey sir really missing u in our pak cricket team
- the Afghanistan Cricket authorities believe Gulbadin has ample experience to lead their side into WC! However, to me, not good timing to dismiss experienced Asghar Afghan as skipper.

@GabbbarSingh @vikrantarora24 I beg to disagree. A person may be interested in cricket but not way too interested. For eg,I generally use their pop up swiggy to book more often these days.Yes the percentage of people alike me would be very less though. In fact we like to know how many actually buy like that.

@AnnieChave @aidybidd @theanalyst @ToppersSnr @tomjohnson5788 @telecricket @gurneyhf It is, but being inspired by what you see on the TV is a big part of getting into the game. I played cricket at school for two years without really getting it or enjoying it, it was only when I watched warne in the 93 ashes that I suddenly felt inspired to want to play.

@Changing366 @ChiranjitOjha @IndSuperLeague @Changing366 you are not getting my point. Cricket is obviously boring in a 20-team league. With football, the more teams in a league, the more exciting and competitive it gets. Thats why people watch the premier league or laliga or serie a or bundesliga

@sanjaymanjrekar It's important to keep Kohli calm and fresh. Now e is immense pressure in his batting and captaincy. So I think e need some rest before WC to come good. IPL is just entertainment for us and money for them.

Loving seeing so many football/ cricket pitches with running tracks around them with little clubhouses, some with floodlights too here in Barbados. Saw a local men's cup match last night them kids training after school. 74 football clubs in a popn of 275k
Love this from #Budget2019 as indicative of #ScoMo priorities. T20 cricket gets &gt;$7m. Then $9.5m over 4 yrs to train 5000 GPs to identify ppl experiencing #domesticviolence. So 1 in 6 GPs to spot the abused. Guess so. @JulieCollinsMP @LaTrioli @vanOnselenP @PatsKarvelas

@ovshake42 @senantix @Cricket_Books Of course they did. Your just circular. You just quoted respectable historians who spread the word and still admired him.
@Bluetrainz1974 @senantix @Cricket_Books If you agree that Cardus need not be taken seriously for facts, should not be considered a journalist, and should be hailed only for his prose, I think we are on the same page.
@Bluetrainz1974 @ovshake42 @Cricket_Books Yes we care about the truth. Cardus misled generations by painting wrong pictures of facts and personalities, camouflaging them as match reports. He did this in his capacity as a journalist for Manchester Guardian.But it is pointless to discuss any further

@ovshake42 @senantix @Cricket_Books So according to you journalism standards never change and in 100 years your view should and must be the only view of journalism. You will be sadly disappointed. Everyone knew cardus was a poet of cricket. To call him a fraud or a liar says more about your quest than him.

@cricBC T-20, in fact ODI too is a cruel game for bowlers. Too much loaded in favour of batsmen. Not a healthy cricket. Apart from free hits to batsmen and other bowling restrictions,the boundaries are made 15-20 yards shorter. It is a cruel joke to play with 60-65 yards boundaries.

@anubhav_roda @akshar2026 @IPL @StarSportsIndia @DelhiCapitals I have no clue why would any team go for a player whose T20 SR is terrible. Plus, even if you take that sort of a batsman you need to put him at no. 3 as an innings stabilizer. Asking him to finish games or give the late flourish is asking too much from him.

Royal Challengers Bangalore trying to get their first win of IPL 2019 face a  mighty challenger in the form of Kolkata Knight Riders, who are in red hot form in IPL 2019. Andre Russell will be a great threat, keeping in perspective, the way he has been smashing it all around.
-another problem there is with the double headers and all that is tv time, the Feb to march period is perfect for the womans game cos there is no other sport dominating the scene then. cricket is over and the mens hasn't quiet started. so there is a slot in Sevens sport coverage-

"Test batting average of 49.08, something only 47 men have bettered in the 135 yrs Test Cricket has been played, &amp; which places him above such luminaries as Peter May, Neil Harvey, Ted Dexter &amp; Rohan Kanhai ‚Äì yet people remember him just for his fielding."https://t.co/pRQpuRWU5o https://t.co/25W4lO8qsr
@Tim32_cricket @investor_bod @WorcsCCC Signed Rutherford today for the first month before Ferguson arrives.  Plus Wessels, so think batting will be ok.  Big question is who to open with Mitch.  Probably Fell?

I feel like artists and athletes can both go through slumps, but yoh, when you're finally due and everything clicks, it's fucking magic. Tonight felt like coming out of a slump for me. To put in cricket terms, I just scored a century after 5 ducks in a row. Feels good man.

Okay so @DelhiCapitals go down once again and this time comprehensively to the impressive @SunRisers. Their batting is an issue. Unless they start putting up good totals with the bat their bowling attack cannot win them games. #DCvSRH #IPL2019 #Cricket

@IExpressSports @IndianExpress I don't think so. Jimmy Anderson is a fast bowler and its somehow difficult to #Mankad folling a long runup. Also he only plays test cricket and unlike in T20,  nonstricker need not gear up from the crease in Test cricket.

@Cricket_Blogger No no. Not worried about performance of any of the top 3 in world cup. Confident about them. Just that Rohit's approach while opening in IPL is very risky. He plays too many dots. The day he cashes in, it's alright. But when he fails, it more likely to hamper his team
